## Detailed Description


This class is where the bulk of the robot should be declared. Since Command-based is a "declarative" paradigm, very little robot logic should actually be handled in the `Robot` periodic methods (other than the scheduler calls). Instead, the structure of the robot (including subsystems, commands, and trigger mappings) should be declared here.
